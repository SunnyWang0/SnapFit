AI Body Fat Analyser

Uses gpt prompt to analyze the photo for body fat percentage and returns a value, and a picture of a celebrity that has a similar body fat percentage.

Once user downloads app, on first open, they will be asked questions to set up their profile.
- Name for storage purposes on our end? if that makes sense? I have never developed an IOS app so recommend me the best way to store user data
- age, gender, this will be one screen
- height, weight, this will be one screen
- activity level, goal, this will be one screen
- After the goal, show a screen with a graphic of a graph that shows progress over time curve, better than without the app
- After inputting all user information, the user will face a paywall screen asking if they want to unlock the app for $4.99
- The user can only move forward if they tap unlock and pay $4.99
- Above the payment portion, say a motivational message that promotes the app, like reach your fitness goals with accurate tracking and AI body composition analysis
- User will be able to edit their profile at any time in the settings

3 main tabs with the tabs on the bottom of the screen
Left side tab is Home with Home icon:
- This is where the graph will be displayed
- The graph will track the users body fat percentage over time and match it with the photos
- The graph will have a y axis of body fat percentage and an x axis of time. 
- User will be able to click into each point on the graph to view the photo that was taken at that time, the body fat percentage, and the celebrity comparison.

Middle tab, rounded, camera icon:
- Will display the camera viewfinder with a frame to take a photo
- Takes photo and stores it in the database that holds all user photos, locally?
- Sends photo to GPT-4o to analyze the photo for body fat percentage
- Start with just body fat percentage, later add muscle, bone, water, etc. percentages, this is depending on gpt capabilities

Right side tab, similar style to the left side tab, make it symmetric:
- This is where the user settings and preferences will be
