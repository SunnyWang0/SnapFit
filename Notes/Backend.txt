Create a backend endpoint on Cloudflare

- Whenever a user takes a photo, send the photo to the backend endpoint
- Backend endpoint sends the photo to GPT
- Get a response from the model
- Returns the response to the user

In order to enhance backend authentication:

1. User-Based Authentication:
- When a user first installs and opens the app, generate a unique device identifier
- Make an initial registration request to your Cloudflare Worker
- The Worker generates a unique API key for this device/user
- Store this API key securely in the iOS Keychain

2. Request Signing Process:

   Request Structure:
   - API Key (identifies the user)
   - Timestamp (prevents replay attacks)
   - Request ID (unique per request)
   - Signature (HMAC of the request payload)

In order to limit the amount of requests:
- Add count on user side for amount of photos taken
