SnapFit is an app that helps users track their body fat percentage and weight over time.
It allows users to take photos of themselves and get AI body fat analysis done.
In this way, users can make sure that when they are cutting or bulking, they are doing so in a healthy way to meet their goals.

Users will be able to take photos using their camera through the app, or upload photos from their camera roll. 
The users can manually enter their body weight to track that as well. These stats will be tracking in a graph with a dual overlay so they can see how both their body fat percentage and weight are changing over time.
Users will be able to click on different entries to see the photo on that day and compare with other photos of their choosing.
