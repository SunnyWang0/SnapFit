Train model on labeled dataset:

Body pictures in different poses, lighting, and clothing matched with body fat percentage in all ranges

- Multiple images per datapoint

Body fat prediction based on various body measurements
- Can be an extra feature: 
    - instead of using image, use body measurements to predict body fat percentage
